		<h2> Name Assignment </h2>
		<p><img src="images/name.jpg"/ width= "400" height="300"></p>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Use scratch to design and create a program that displays my name.
	The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give 
each letter 3 unique behaviors.The “forever” block was required. The program 
needed to run when the green flag was clicked and and for extra credit I
added a function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag 
was clicked.</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Using event blocks: when green flack clicked, 
when space bar pressed</li>
			<li>Using movement blocks: In order to make the sprite go back to 
its original location when the green flag was clicked, 
I used the x and y values. I also used the “turn to x degrees” 
movement block to make my sprites rotate.</li>
			<li>Using looks blocks: I used the “change size to” block to 
make a sprite enlarge and shrink continuously when the spacebar 
was pressed. I also used the “change color effect” to make a 
sprite change costume.</li>
			<li>Sprites: I used library of sprites to find letters in my name 
and adjusted the costumes.</li>
			<li>Using Control Blocks: I used forever and repeat loops to 
make a sprite’s behavior continuous.</li>
			<li>Using conditional statements: I used if statements to start 
a sprite’s behavior when the spacebar was pressed. I also used 
if statements to reset my name when the green flag was clicked.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2> Computer Buying Project </h2>
		<p><img src="images/computer.jpg"/ width= "400" height="300"></p>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Use scratch to design and create a presentation or animation that 
displays four different computers and their properties and give advice on 
which computer to buy based on the interview responses.
The requirements were to add a title with the group members’ names, the 
questions and answers of the interview chosen, the four 
computers and visuals of your choices, the computer comparison chart, 
the chosen computer and justification for choosing that computer. Finally, 
the students should be prepared to answer questions.</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Using movement, control, event blocks and conditional 
statements. </li>
			<li>Using Broadcast blocks: I used the broadcast block to 
make the characters speak to each other. Broadcast was also used to 
switch background scenes and make the animation reset itself as the green 
flag was clicked.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2> Scratch Game Project </h2>
		<p><img src="images/game.jpg"/ width= "400" height="300"></p>
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Use all knowledge and skills learned to create and design 
a game or a story in scratch.If you chose to program a game, the 
requirements were to let the player know if they win, keep score, 
have a timer,have a help screen with directions, the game resets 
when the green flag is clicked, the game stops when it is over, 
and more than one level. If you chose to make a story, the requirements 
were to have at least 3 scenes,3 different sprites, 8 say or think boxes, 
animate the movement of the characters, use broadcast to change scenes in 
your story, have the characters take turns speaking to each other, have 
at least one conversation between characters, and have a title scene 
with name. Finally, the story should reset itself when the green flag 
is clicked. </p>
	<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Using movement, looks, loops, sensing and event blocks.</li>
		<li>Using conditional statements.</li>
		<li>Using variables: I created and set variables to create a 
		timer and keep count of the player’s score.</li>
	</ul>
