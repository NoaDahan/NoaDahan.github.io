		<h2>Why this is my favorite movie</h2>
		<p>This is my favorite movie because it is based on a true story.
		I particularly enjoyed learning about how cracking the enigma code led England to Victory 
		during World War II. 
		I additionally loved learning about Alan Turing and especially how Turing's work inspired research into "Turing machines," 
		now known as computers.</p>
		<h2>Favorite Actor</h2>
		<p>One of my favorite characters in the movie is Joan Clarke because she is really inspiring and powerful.
		I really loved Keira Kneightley 
		because she portrayed Joan Clarke really well.</p>
